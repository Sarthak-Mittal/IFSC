        <h3 class="about point">What this project is about?</h3>
        This project aims to help you get your bank details with your IFSC code. I tend to forget where my bank branch is located or does it offer services like UPI, NEFT, RTGS or IMPS. So I think this will help serve the purpose for people who might want to look up some information about their bank branch.

        <h3 class="about point">What is IFSC?</h3>
        IFSC is short for Indian Financial System Code and represents the 11 digit character that you can usually see on your bankâ€™s cheque leaves, or other bank sponsored material. This 11 character code helps identify the individual bank branches that participate in the various online money transfer options like NEFT and RTGS.
