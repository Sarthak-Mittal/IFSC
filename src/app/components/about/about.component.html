  <h2>What is IFSC?</h2>

  <p>IFSC or Indian Financial System Code is an alpha-numeric code that uniquely identifies a bank-branch participating
    in the NEFT system. Itâ€™s a 11-digit code with the first 4 alpha characters representing the bank, and the last 6
    characters representing the branch. The 5th character is 0 (zero).
  </p>
  <p>
    IFSC is used by the NEFT system to identify the originating / destination banks / branches and also to route the
    messages appropriately to the concerned banks / branches.
